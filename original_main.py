"""This simpy model mimics the arrival and treatment of patients in an
emergency department with a limited number of doctors. Patients are generated,
wait for a doc (if none available), take up the doc resources for the time of
consulation, and exit the ED straight after seeing doc. Patients are of three
priorities (1=high to 3=low) and docs will always see higher priority patients
first (though they do not interrupt lower priority patients already being seen).

The model has four classes:

Global_vars: holds global variables

Model: holds model environemnt and th emain model run methods

Patient: each patient is an object instance of this class. This class also holds
    a static variable (dictionary) containing all patient objects currently in
    the simulation model.

Resources: defines the doc resources required to see/treat patient.

    Model class contains the following methods:

    __init__:  constructor for initiating simpy simulation environment.

    build_audit_results: At end of model run, transfers results held in lists
        into a pandas DataFrame.

    chart: At end of model run, plots model results using MatPlotLib.

    perform_audit: Called at each audit interval. Records simulation time, total
        patients waiting, patients waiting by priority, and number of docs
        occupied. Will then schedule next audit.

    run: Called immediately after initialising simulation object. This method:
        1) Calls method to set up doc resources.
        2) Initialises the two starting processes: patient admissions and audit.
        3) Starts model envrionment.
        4) Save individual patient level results to csv
        5) Calls the build_audit_results metha and saves to csv
        6) Calls the chart method to plot results

    see_doc: After a patient arrives (generated in the trigger_admissions
        method of this class), this see_doc process method is called (with
        patient object passed to process method). This process requires a free
        doc resource (resource objects held in this model class). The request is
        prioritised by patient priority (lower priority numbers grab resources
        first). The number of patients waiting is incremented, and doc resources
        are requested. Once doc resources become available queuing times are
        recorded (these are saved to global results if warm up period has been
        completed). The patient is held for teh required time with doc (held in
        patient object) and then time with doc recorded. The patient is then
        removed from the Patient calss dictionary (which triggers Python to
        remove the patient object).

    trigger_admissions: Generates new patient admissions. Each patient is an
        instance of the Patient obect class. This method allocates each
        patient an ID, adds the patient to the dictionary of patients held by
        the Patient class (static class variable), initiates a simpy process
        (in this model class) to see a doc, and schedules the next admission.
